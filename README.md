# funny-errors
Tired of the same old errors? Why not prank your friends with these?
I have developed Prankerrors. Have a laugh when you go through my errors and check out what they say! You might say, "How did you do that?"
Well, I used Visual Studio Code and followed some tutorials for making message boxes! I used the VBScript language. Don't worry, you don't need any software to use this.
It's mostly whats used to make error boxes in Microsoft operating systems. Just click on the file and BAM! You got yourself an error. Have fun pranking your friends!
For suggestions, comment on this repository online. See you around!
